## Summary of Findings

This test report validates the stability and functional output of the AI Review Agent (v1.2). The system was subjected to a **manual load test of 25 unique Pull Requests**.

The system is **STABLE**, processing all 25 PRs without crashing. The AI model is **FUNCTIONAL**, consistently identifying specific, valid code bugs in the generated reviews.

| :----------------------------------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. System Stability (Load Test)**  | **PASS** | Manually processed 25/25 PRs by updating the `pr_list` in `main.py`.                    |
| **2. Functional Output (AI Review)** | **PASS** | Generated 25+ review files. AI correctly identified code-level bugs.                    |
| **3. AI Learning (Persistence)**     | **PASS** | `selector_state.json` was successfully updated with 25 new data points.                 |
| **4. Environment / Dependencies**    | **WARN** | Project dependencies are out of date. Required manual fixes for `langchain_core` paths. |

## Detailed Test Cases

### Test 1: System Stability & Load Testing

- **Objective:** Verify the system can process a high volume of diverse PRs without crashing.
- **Action:** Manually edited `main.py` to include `pr_list = list(range(1, 26))` and ran the script.
- **Result:** **PASS**. The script ran to completion and processed all 25 PRs successfully.

### Test 2: Functional Output & AI Quality

- **Objective:** Verify the AI agent produces a valid, relevant code review for each PR.
- **Action:** Spot-checked all 25 generated `review_pr*.txt` files.
- **Evidence:** `review_pr1_Zero-shot.txt`, `review_pr2_Zero-shot.txt`, etc.
- **Result:** **PASS**. The AI agent is functional and consistently identifies correct bug classes.

#### Key Observations from AI Reviews:

- **PRs (1, 6, 11, 16, 21):** Correctly identified a classic **"off-by-one error"** in `sum_range` (`i < b` instead of `i <= b`).
- **PRs (2, 7, 12, 17, 22):** Correctly identified **`KeyError`** and **`ValueError`** risks from unvalidated dictionary access in the `parse_user` function.
- **PRs (3, 8, 13, 18, 23):** Correctly identified multiple logical flaws in the cache implementation, including **no thread safety**, **no size limit**, and **no expiration mechanism**.
- **PRs (4, 9, 14, 19, 24):** Correctly identified the critical **missing `None` check** in the `is_authenticated` function, which would cause a crash.
- **PRs (5, 10, 15, 20, 25):** Correctly identified the bad practice of using a **broad `except Exception as e`** block, which masks specific errors.

### Bugs & Issues Found

- **Issue 1: Dependency Errors (High Severity)**
  - **Description:** The project failed to run on a clean install due to outdated `langchain` imports.
  - **Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langchain.prompts'`
  - **Fix:** Manually updated import paths in `prompts_v2.py` and `reviewer.py` to use `langchain_core` (e.g., `from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate`).
