**Code Review**

The provided GitHub Pull Request diff introduces a new Python file, `synthetic_pr_01.py`, which contains a function `sum_range` to calculate the inclusive sum of integers from `a` to `b`. Here's a review of the code:

### Bugs and Mistakes

1. **Off-by-one error**: The `while` loop condition is `i < b`, which should be `i <= b` to include the value `b` in the sum. This is a classic off-by-one error.
2. **Lack of input validation**: The function does not check if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the function will return 0, which might not be the expected behavior.
3. **No error handling**: The function does not handle any potential errors that might occur during execution.

### Suggestions

1. **Fix the off-by-one error**: Change the `while` loop condition to `i <= b`.
2. **Add input validation**: Check if `a` is less than or equal to `b` and raise a `ValueError` if not.
3. **Add unit tests**: As suggested in the code comment, add unit tests to verify the correctness of the `sum_range` function.
4. **Consider using a more efficient algorithm**: The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the range of values from `a` to `b`. A more efficient algorithm would be to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (a + b) / 2`, where `n` is the number of terms in the series.
5. **Add docstrings**: Add docstrings to the function to provide a description of what the function does, its parameters, and its return value.

### Example of Improved Code

```python
def sum_range(a, b):
    """
    Returns the inclusive sum of integers from a to b.

    Args:
        a (int): The start of the range (inclusive).
        b (int): The end of the range (inclusive).

    Returns:
        int: The sum of integers from a to b.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If a is greater than b.
    """
    if a > b:
        raise ValueError("a must be less than or equal to b")

    # Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series
    n = b - a + 1
    return n * (a + b) // 2
```

### Unit Tests

```python
import unittest

class TestSumRange(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_sum_range(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_range(1, 5), 15)
        self.assertEqual(sum_range(10, 15), 75)
        self.assertEqual(sum_range(1, 1), 1)

    def test_input_validation(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            sum_range(5, 1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
