**Code Review**

The provided GitHub Pull Request diff introduces a new Python file `synthetic_pr_02.py` with a function `parse_user`. Here are some observations, potential bugs, and suggestions:

### Potential Bugs and Issues

1. **KeyError**: The code does not handle cases where the input dictionary `data` is missing the keys `'name'` or `'age'`. This will raise a `KeyError` exception.
2. **ValueError**: The code assumes that the value of `'age'` can be converted to an integer. If the value is not a valid integer (e.g., a string), a `ValueError` exception will be raised.
3. **Type Error**: The code does not check the type of the input `data`. If `data` is not a dictionary, a `TypeError` exception will be raised when trying to access its keys.
4. **Lack of Input Validation**: The function does not validate the input data beyond checking for the presence of certain keys. For example, it does not check if the `'name'` value is empty or if the `'age'` value is within a valid range.

### Suggestions

1. **Add Input Validation**: Implement robust input validation to ensure that the input data conforms to the expected format. This can include checks for the presence of required keys, data types, and valid ranges.
2. **Use Try-Except Blocks**: Wrap the code that accesses the dictionary keys and converts the `'age'` value to an integer in try-except blocks to catch and handle potential exceptions.
3. **Consider Using a More Robust Data Validation Library**: Libraries like `marshmallow` or `pydantic` can provide more comprehensive data validation and error handling capabilities.
4. **Add Docstrings and Comments**: Include docstrings and comments to explain the purpose of the function, its expected input and output, and any assumptions or constraints.

### Example Refactored Code

```python
def parse_user(data):
    """
    Parse user data from a dictionary.

    Args:
        data (dict): Dictionary containing 'name' and 'age' keys.

    Returns:
        dict: Parsed user data with 'name' and 'age' keys.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input data is invalid.
    """
    if not isinstance(data, dict):
        raise ValueError("Input data must be a dictionary")

    required_keys = ['name', 'age']
    for key in required_keys:
        if key not in data:
            raise ValueError(f"Missing required key: {key}")

    try:
        name = data['name'].strip()
        age = int(data['age'])
    except ValueError as e:
        raise ValueError("Invalid age value") from e

    return {'name': name, 'age': age}
```

This refactored code includes input validation, try-except blocks, and docstrings to improve the robustness and readability of the `parse_user` function.
