**Code Review**

The provided GitHub Pull Request diff introduces a new Python file, `synthetic_pr_08.py`, which appears to be part of a synthetic PR (Pull Request) for blackbox testing. The code implements a simple cache manager. Here's a review of the code:

### Issues and Suggestions

1. **Cache Implementation**:
   * The cache is implemented as a simple dictionary, which is not thread-safe. If this code is intended to be used in a multi-threaded environment, consider using a thread-safe cache implementation, such as `functools.lru_cache` or a dedicated caching library like `cachetools`.
   * The cache does not have a size limit, which can lead to memory issues if not managed properly. Consider implementing a cache eviction policy to limit the cache size.

2. **Functionality**:
   * The `cache_get` function only retrieves values from the cache. Consider adding a `cache_set` function to store values in the cache.
   * The `cache_get` function returns `None` if the key is not found in the cache. Consider raising a `KeyError` or a custom exception instead, to make it clear that the key is not present in the cache.

3. **Error Handling**:
   * The code does not handle any potential errors that may occur during cache operations. Consider adding try-except blocks to handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.

4. **Code Organization**:
   * The cache implementation is not encapsulated in a class or a separate module. Consider organizing the cache implementation in a separate module or class to improve code reusability and maintainability.

5. **Comments and Documentation**:
   * The code lacks comments and documentation. Consider adding docstrings to the `cache_get` function and other cache-related functions to provide a clear understanding of their purpose and usage.

6. **Testing**:
   * The code does not include any tests to verify its correctness. Consider adding unit tests to ensure the cache implementation works as expected.

### Example Refactored Code

Here's an example of how the code could be refactored to address some of the issues mentioned above:
```python
# src/synthetic_pr_08.py

class CacheManager:
    def __init__(self, max_size=100):
        """
        Initialize the cache manager with a maximum size.

        :param max_size: The maximum size of the cache.
        """
        self.cache = {}
        self.max_size = max_size

    def get(self, key):
        """
        Retrieve a value from the cache.

        :param key: The key to retrieve.
        :return: The value associated with the key, or None if not found.
        """
        try:
            return self.cache[key]
        except KeyError:
            return None

    def set(self, key, value):
        """
        Store a value in the cache.

        :param key: The key to store.
        :param value: The value to store.
        """
        if key in self.cache:
            self.cache[key] = value
        elif len(self.cache) < self.max_size:
            self.cache[key] = value
        else:
            # Implement cache eviction policy here
            pass

# Example usage:
cache_manager = CacheManager(max_size=100)
cache_manager.set("key", "value")
print(cache_manager.get("key"))  # Output: value
```
Note that this is just one possible way to refactor the code, and there are many other approaches to improving the cache implementation.
