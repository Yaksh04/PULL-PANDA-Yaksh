**Code Review**

### Bugs and Mistakes

1. **Off-by-one error**: The condition in the while loop should be `i <= b` instead of `i < b`. This is because the function is supposed to return the inclusive sum of integers from `a` to `b`. With the current condition, the last integer `b` will not be included in the sum.
2. **Lack of input validation**: The function does not check if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the function will return 0, which might not be the expected behavior.
3. **No error handling**: The function does not handle any potential errors that might occur during execution.

### Suggestions

1. **Add unit tests**: As suggested in the code comment, adding unit tests for this module would be beneficial to ensure the function works correctly for different inputs.
2. **Improve code readability**: The code could be made more readable by adding comments to explain the purpose of the function and the logic behind it.
3. **Consider using a more efficient algorithm**: The current implementation uses a while loop to calculate the sum, which has a time complexity of O(n). A more efficient algorithm would be to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which has a time complexity of O(1).
4. **Add type hints**: Adding type hints for the function parameters and return type would make the code more readable and self-documenting.

### Example of Improved Code

```python
def sum_range(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the inclusive sum of integers from a to b.
    
    Args:
    a (int): The start of the range.
    b (int): The end of the range.
    
    Returns:
    int: The sum of integers from a to b.
    """
    if a > b:
        raise ValueError("a must be less than or equal to b")
    
    # Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series
    return (b - a + 1) * (a + b) // 2
```

### Example Unit Tests

```python
import unittest

class TestSumRange(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_sum_range(self):
        self.assertEqual(sum_range(1, 5), 15)
        self.assertEqual(sum_range(10, 15), 75)
        self.assertEqual(sum_range(1, 1), 1)
        
    def test_invalid_input(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            sum_range(5, 1)
            
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
