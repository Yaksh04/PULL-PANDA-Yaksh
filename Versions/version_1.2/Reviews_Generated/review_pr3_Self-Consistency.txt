Here are three concise reviews:

**Review A**: The updated code uses SQLAlchemy 2.0 style with type annotations, which is a good practice. However, the old code is still present in the file, which is unnecessary.

**Review B**: The new code is well-structured and uses type annotations, but it would be better to remove the old code and add a clear commit message explaining the changes. Additionally, the indexes added to the User table can improve query performance.

**Review C**: The code migration to SQLAlchemy 2.0 style is mostly correct, but it's worth noting that the `datetime` import is missing in the old code. The new code is more readable and maintainable, and the added indexes can significantly improve query performance.

Comparing the reviews for clarity, correctness, and actionability, I select:

**Review B** 
because it provides a clear and concise summary of the changes, suggests improvements, and highlights the benefits of the updates.
