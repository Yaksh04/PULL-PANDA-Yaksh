## Step 1: Summarize what changed
A new file `README.md` has been added to the project, containing documentation for a calculator library. The library provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Step 2: Identify functional/logic bugs
There are no functional or logic bugs in the provided diff, as it only contains documentation and does not include any code that could potentially contain bugs. However, it's worth noting that the `divide` function is mentioned in the documentation, but it's not shown in the usage example. It would be good to include a check for division by zero in the actual implementation of the `divide` function.

## Step 3: Identify style/maintainability issues
The provided documentation is clear and concise, making it easy to understand the available functions and their usage. However, it would be beneficial to include more details about the library, such as any dependencies it may have, and to provide more comprehensive usage examples. Additionally, it would be a good practice to include information about how to handle potential errors, such as division by zero.

## Step 4: Suggest prioritized fixes
1. **Add a check for division by zero**: In the actual implementation of the `divide` function, add a check to raise an error or return a specific value when attempting to divide by zero.
2. **Include more comprehensive usage examples**: Add more examples to the documentation to demonstrate how to use the library, including error handling.
3. **Provide information about dependencies and error handling**: Update the documentation to include information about any dependencies the library may have, and how to handle potential errors.

## Final Review
The added `README.md` file provides clear documentation for the calculator library, but it lacks comprehensive usage examples and information about error handling. Prioritized fixes should focus on adding checks for division by zero, including more examples, and providing information about dependencies and error handling to improve the library's maintainability and usability.
